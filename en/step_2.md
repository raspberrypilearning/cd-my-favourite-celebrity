## Get started

**Note:** you can complete this project without an account on trinket.io, but without an account you will not be able to use your own pictures. Please create an account if you wish to use your own pictures. Instructions on how to do this are below. 

Go to the [starter trinket here](http://dojo.soy/celebrity){:target="_blank"}. You'll see a box containing an example website project. On the right-hand side is the website, and on the left-hand side is the code that makes the website.

- Click the **Remix** button at the top right of the project. If you are not signed in, you will be prompted to do so. Once you've signed in, you'll need to click **Remix** again. Clicking this button creates a copy of the project for you to work with.

The button should say **remixed** after you click it:

You can save your work by using one of the options in the **Share** menu. You will get a link that you can copy and either save somewhere, for example in a document, or send to someone via email.

**Note:** each time you make a change to your code, you will get a new link.

If you want to create an account on Trinket, follow the steps below. This will allow you to access your work easily from any computer, and to **remix** projects somebody else has shared with you. Remixing means you save a copy of a project to your account so you can make your own changes to it.

- Go to [the Trinket website](http://dojo.soy/trinket) and click **Sign Up For Your Free Account**. You will need an email address to sign up. 

- Enter your email address and choose a password, or ask somebody to do this for you.

- You can now access all your saved or remixed projects by clicking on your username and going to **My Trinkets**.

Find the line that says `<p>Hello World</p>` and replace the text between `<p>` and `</p>` to say who your favourite celebrity is. **Don't** remove the `<p>` and `</p>`. These are **paragraph** HTML tags. They are used to define a paragraph of text. You should see your web page change on the right-hand side.

Add a new line, and this time use `<h1>` and `</h1>` instead of `<p>` and `</p>`. These are **heading** HTML tags. They enlarge the text in between them and make it bold.

```html
  <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
```

**HTML** is the language that makes your web page.

The `.html` in the file name, which you can see at the top of the left-hand side of the trinket, tells the browser that the file is a web page, so the browser knows to look for **tags** telling it what to display. (A browser is the program you use to look at websites, for example Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.)

HTML tags such as `<p>` and `</p>` define different pieces of a page, for example paragraphs, headings, or the body. The pieces are all called **elements**. Think of them as building blocks for web pages.

### Why do I need two tags? 
You need an **opening** and a **closing** tag to tell the browser where an element **starts** and **ends**. So for a paragraph, the opening tag `<p>` says "Here comes some text that I want you to display as a paragraph." to the browser, and the closing tag `</p>` tells the browser where the paragraph ends. 

Everything in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags is your web page. 

- Notice how the closing tag **always** has a forward slash `/`.

Change the number in your heading tags to see the different heading sizes that are available. They can go from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. Remember to change the number in both the opening and closing tags!

Congratulations â€” you have built your first web page. Next, you will style the web page!
