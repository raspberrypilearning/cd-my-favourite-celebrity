## Add YouTube videos to your page

Adding elements from other online sources is called **embedding**. YouTube provides an easy way for you to embed its videos in your web page. Let's include a video about your celebrity. For this example, I'm adding a video from Maddie's YouTube channel, but you could add an interview, music video, movie trailer, or any other clip with your favourite celebrity.

Find a video on YouTube that you want to show on your website. 

Click on the **Share** button below the video, beside the likes. Select the option **Embed**.

You will see a text box with some code in it, which you'll need to copy. The easiest way to do that is this: select it all by clicking on it and pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac) and <kbd>A</kbd> keys at the same time.

Then to copy the text, press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac) and <kbd>C</kbd> keys at the same time, or right-click and select **Copy**.

Now go back to your website's HTML code, and click in the place where you want to put the video, for example below a heading or paragraph. Add the code you've copied by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac) and <kbd>V</kbd> on your keyboard at the same time, or by right-clicking and selecting **Paste**. Don't worry about understanding all the code you just pasted! You should see the video appear on your web page.

If you look carefully, you should find `width` and `height` **attributes** in the pasted code. You can change their values to make your video appear bigger or smaller.
